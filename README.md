# ideas
A collection of ideas.

Trying to decide what to do with my life. Collecting the ideas here to have something to base the decision on.

I would love your feedback and contributions! I do not claim any kind of ownership of anything here, feel free to steal any idea
you want and make it yours.

So in terms of ideas, what is mine is yours. This also means that I will treat your ideas as mine, too. If you share an idea with me, I will not hesitate to put it here for the whole world to see. If you want to keep your idea secret from the world, you better keep it secret from me too.
