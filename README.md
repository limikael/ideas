My name is Micke and I currently live in Ubud, Bali, where I work on realizing my dreams.
I have a background as software developer, teacher and maker.
For more information about my backgroud, please see my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LH4D9xRFnPktjyZraACYNeUw9q7Ja0BXg5E8PX0Whus/edit?usp=sharing)!

The ideas are in various stages of development. The top 3 that I currently spend most time on to make the vision concrete 
are these:

- [Banana Leaf Books](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/BananaLeafBooks.md)
- [Make At The Onion](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/MakeAtTheOnion.md)
- [Post Scarcity Robotics](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/PostScarcityRobotics.md)

These ideas are connected and part of something bigger though, which I would like to call "Post Scarcity Robotics".
The idea with the same name above, as well as the
[crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/post-scarcity-robotics) I did late 2017 with the same name,
begins to  explain it, but this is only the beginning. The big dream and idea is bigger than is shown in those videos, 
and it is related to [Post Scarcity Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy) and the 
[Zeitgeist Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_(film_series)). In the Wikipedia article about the 
Zeitgeist Movement it is talked about "speculative technology" and "fully automated production", so I guess 
I can say that my dream is to be an integral part of making this technology real. I do believe that I have gathered the
skills during my career to do this, my approach to do it is right, and now is the time. My approach here means to
take small steps, and make the steps useful all the way. It is an 
[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) approach. This is slightly different than projects such 
as [The Venus Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco#The_Venus_Project_and_later_career) which is often
highlighted in relation to the Zeitgeist Movement. The Venus Project proposes a big centralized research project, 
whereas I would like to take small incremental steps. My approach takes into account the model that has proven very 
useful in the creation of [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). Open source
software is not owned or controlled by any corporation or organisation, but can be said to be owned collectively
by all of humanity. It exists all around us, some examples are The Internet, the operating systems for Android and iPhone
smartphones, Wordpress, Wikipedia, and many more. I believe that many people use this software every day, without 
reflecting upon where it comes, how it was created, or how important its existance is in order to ensure decentralization
and sustainibility. Perhaps including the creator of The Venus Project?

In the end I dream about a self replicating fully automated factory, that can automatically produce itself, 
as well as all the material things we need. This concept has been called a 
[seed factory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories). I have heard that the 3D printer has been called 
humanity's first self replicating machine. I would like to challenge this, because a 3D printer can only print the 
parts of itself. I would like to create a machine to actually automatically assemble those parts.

What's more... It isn't that crazy, and actually just a small evolutionary step based on what already exists, 
and I think my little Mavis robot with a universal tool mount on it can actually do it.

## Intellectual Property
I would love your feedback and contributions! I do not claim any kind of ownership of anything here, 
feel free to steal any idea you want and make it yours.

So in terms of ideas, what is mine is yours. This also means that I will treat your ideas as belonging to everyone, 
inclucing myself, too. If you share an idea with me, I will not hesitate to put it here for the whole world to see. 
If you want to keep your idea secret from the world, you better keep it secret from me too.
