# ideas
A collection of ideas.

Trying to decide what to do with my life. Collecting the ideas here to have something to base the decision on.

Who am I and what is my background? Please see my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LH4D9xRFnPktjyZraACYNeUw9q7Ja0BXg5E8PX0Whus/edit?usp=sharing)!

The ideas are in various stages of development. The top 3 that currently have the highest chance of seeing any actual work
being done on them are:

- [Banana Leaf Publishing](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/BananaLeafPublishing.md)
- [Make At The Onion](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/MakeAtTheOnion.md)
- [Post Scarcity Robotics](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/PostScarcityRobotics.md)

## Intellectual Property
I would love your feedback and contributions! I do not claim any kind of ownership of anything here, 
feel free to steal any idea you want and make it yours.

So in terms of ideas, what is mine is yours. This also means that I will treat your ideas as belonging to everyone, inclucing myself, too. If you share an idea with me, I will not hesitate to put it here for the whole world to see. If you want to keep your idea secret from the world, you better keep it secret from me too.
