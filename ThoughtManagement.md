# Thought Management

## Problem

I need a way to get my thoughts out of my head, and manage and share them with the relevant audience. I think faster than I
type on a keyboard, so writing them down does not really work. I have found it to be very useful to record voice memos, so it
would be great if I could manage my thoughts and ideas as voice memos.

## Solution

A platform (e.g. a web site and an app) to record and share voice memos. This would have the same functions as soundcloud,
but with some additions.

## Tagging and sharing

An important function is tagging. Tagging would work in a similar way as tagging of facebook. Once a voice recording is
uploaded, it would be possible to tag people in it. This can be used if a thought is about someone else, and if it 

## Services

Once the thoughts are recorded, the platform can act as a marketplace for related services. For example, such services could be:

- Transcription
- Turn the thoughts into a radio show. Someone who is skilled in audio editing, can take the thought and add in questions (so the thoughts becomes answers to questions). They can also do research and add relevant background information.
- Transcription + editing according to a template. The template can be a business plan, so it would be possible to take several random audio files, listen to them, transcribe them, and then edit them so the result is a professionally looking business plan.

## Examples
