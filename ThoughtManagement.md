# Thought Management

## Problem

I need a way to get my thoughts out of my head, and manage and share them with the relevant audience. I think faster than I
type on a keyboard, so writing them down does not really work. I have found it to be very useful to record voice memos, so it
would be great if I could manage my thoughts and ideas as voice memos.

## Solution

A platform (e.g. a web site and an app) to record and share voice memos. This would have the same functions as soundcloud,
but with some additions.

## Tagging and sharing

An important function is tagging. Tagging would work in a similar way as tagging of facebook. Once a voice recording is
uploaded, it would be possible to tag people in it. This can be used if a thought is about someone else, and to give that
someone a chance to respond. This can be used for consumers to share their thoughts about a business, and to give the 
business a chance to comment on the thought.

## Services

Once the thoughts are recorded, the platform can act as a marketplace for related services. For example, such services could be:

- Transcription
- Turn the thoughts into a radio show. Someone who is skilled in audio editing, can take the thought and add in questions (so the thoughts becomes answers to questions). They can also do research and add relevant background information.
- Transcription + editing according to a template. The template can be a business plan, so it would be possible to take several random audio files, listen to them, transcribe them, and then edit them so the result is a professionally looking business plan.

## Examples

There are some example thougts about this platform itself here:

There is a total of 3 audio files there (15 minutes). If your time is limited and you just want to listen to one of them,
please start by listening to [this](https://soundcloud.com/li-mikael/thought-management-use-case?in=li-mikael/sets/thought-management) one (6 minutes).

## Experiment

In order to find out weather it actually works to outsource the task of turning random thoughts into a scructured
business plan or presentation I'm in the process of conducting an experiment. It would be brilliant if I could walk
around like a mad professor and record thoughts, and then I can push a button and then dance in on stage and present
the idea as if it is something real. The experiment will be done like this:

  1. Record random thoughts about this platform itself - ___Done___
  2. Have them transcribed. - ___Done___ They are [here](https://github.com/limikael/ideas/blob/master/data/ThoughtManagementTranscriptions.md).
  3. Put one or several jobs on fiverr. The jobs can be:
    - Turn the thoughts into a powerpoint with 7 slides.
    - Turn the thoughts into a leaflet.

The transcription is a very mechanical task, and it went quite smooth using [Dictate2Us](https://www.dictate2us.com/). In
turning it into presentable material, some creativity is needed. I think the quality of the end result will depend a lot
on how the task is formulated.
