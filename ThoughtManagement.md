# Thought Management

## Problem

I need a way to get my thoughts out of my head, and manage and share them with the relevant audience. I think faster than I
type on a keyboard, so writing them down does not really work. I have found it to be very useful to record voice memos, so it
would be great if I could manage my thoughts and ideas as voice memos.

## Solution

A platform (e.g. a web site and an app) to record and share voice memos. This would have the same functions as soundcloud,
but with some additions.

## Services

Once the thoughts are recorded, the platform can act as a marketplace for related services. For example, such services could be:

- Transcription
- Turn the thoughts into a radio show. Someone who is skilled in audio editing, can take the thought and add in questions (so the thoughts becomes answers to questions). They can also do research and add relevant background information.
- Transcription + editing according to a template. The template can be a business plan, so it would be possible to take several random audio files, listen to them, transcribe them, and then edit them so the result is a professionally looking business plan.

## Examples

There are some example thougts about this platform itself here:
