# Smart Socket

This is a little IoT device that turns on and off electricity with a smart card. It can be used in a Makerspace
to turn on and off tools, so makers pay only for the tools they use.

It can be realized with a NodeMCU (since it has WiFi), and an MFRC522 FRID reader. Also needs a relay to turn electricity
on and off, and a central server that knows the balance for each smart card.
