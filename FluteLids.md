# Flute Lids

I would love learn to play a bamboo flute. My experience as a saxophone player makes this easier than it would be to learn
from scratch. However, I'm not used to use my fingers to exactly cover the holes of a flute, since a saxophone has lids. It
would be quite easy to 3D print lids for a flute, to make a flute easier to play for saxophonists. This will also be very
useful for instruments like the [Saxmonica](http://saxmonica.com/).
