# Make At The Onion

There are several ideas in this repository that relies on maker robotics. However, I don't have access to a makerspace.
I currently reside in Ubud in Bali. There are makerspaces in Bali, but not in Ubud. I would really love to have a makerspace
here.

- Start small and organic.
- Create a sound proof room at Onion Collective.
- Get a 3D printer, tools, power drill and power saw.
- Make a rig for exactly cutting and drilling holes in PVC pipes.

The idea is to not thing so much initially about how to create a perfect makerspace. I will build the makerspace to suit
the needs of one particular maker, i.e. me. Then, we can apply the principle of atraction rather than promotion. This means
that I think that as people see interesting things going on there, they will ask what is going on and be wanting to participate. In such situations I can honestly reply "I don't know really what the plan is, what do you think the plan should be?". In this way the makerspace can grow slow and organic, to suit the needs of actual makers. Also, initially the plan
will not be to make the makerspace profitable or even financially sustainable. I will see it as my own cost, that gives me
the possibility to make things. There are several possible revenue streams in the future, however.

It is a good thing that initially we don't need to focus on these. As interest grows, we can think about when any of these
should be implemented and in what way.

# MVP

The minimal viable makerspace, so to speak, would be comprised of:

- Sound proof room.
- 3D printer. I would like to buy a [Prusa I3 Mk3](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) preassembeled. $999
