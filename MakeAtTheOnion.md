# Make At The Onion

There are several ideas in this repository that relies on maker robotics. However, I don't have access to a makerspace.
I currently reside in Ubud in Bali. There are makerspaces in Bali, but not in Ubud. I would really love to have a makerspace
here.

- Start small and organic.
- Create a sound proof room at Onion Collective.
- Get a 3D printer, tools, power drill and power saw.
- Make a rig for exactly cutting and drilling holes in PVC pipes.
