# Make At The Onion

The inital idea came to me because I want a space so that I can make stuff, and I really want to make stuff.
There are other makerspaces in Bali, but I don't like the commute down to Denpasar and it is stressful and the 
environment is not as inspiring as in Ubud.
If I can make things in Ubud, and especially if I can make stuff at The Onion, I would love it. 

Now, I don't want to intrude on The Onion and treat The Onion as my personal space. But since there are already thoughts
along these lines at The Onion, this could be a win-win situation. Given my personal motivation for why I want this,
we could grow it slow and organically. At the moment, the thing I would want in my life,
is access to a 3D printer and a place to hang some tools, and a workbench where I can work.

The idea is to take the space below the coworking space and designate an area and build a sound proof room there.
Then I just put the things there that I need to experiment with my robotic stuff. I have a list in my
head of roughly what things those would be. That will be useful for me, but it can also be
useful for the community in the long run. If I just start to make stuff there, we can use attraction rather than
promotion for the makerspace. I will build things, people will see things being built there, they will come and ask 
"what is this? who are you? what are you making?".Even if I'm not there, people will see that there is making going 
on and they might ask such questions to someone else.

This also removes the stress of how to promote it. If we see it as a business venture from the start, then comes the
question of how do we promote it, how do we make it profitable or financially sustainable. 

Instead the idea is to start very slow and organic, just put some tools there and add tools as I need them
or someone else needs them. If someone else wants to come and make things with the limited set of tools that are there, they
can. If they need more tools, we add them. So we grow it organically and on demand.

This way I can also see it as a "cost" rather than an "investment", and I would be willing to carry all the costs associated.
This is because I would get a lot of value from the Onion allowing me put a 3D printer and tools in this space.
This is the win-win, since the Onion wants a makerspace, but all stress is removed since this isn't a business 
venture that must make profit in order to succeed.

# MVP

___The minimal viable makerspace, so to speak, would be comprised of___

- Sound proof room. Built in sections so it can be expanded, disassembeled and moved, if the makerspace grows too big and needs to move. 
- 3D printer. I would like to buy a [Prusa I3 Mk3](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3/) preassembeled. $999
- Power drill with stand. I want to be able to drill holes at exact positions.
- A saw. Maybe a powersaw.

__Things to be built and incorporated in the makerspace___

- Something similar to a mitre box, but for PVC pipes. This will be used to cut PVC pipes in exact lengths and to drill holes at exact locations.

___Initial material to stock___

- PVC pipes
- Ballbearings
- Screws and nuts
