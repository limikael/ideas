# Banana Leaf Publishing

In a cave, in a secret location in Bali, lives a mysterious Woman. She is the maker of books.
The books have a beautiful aura of spirituality, they are handmade of rice paper, and beutifully decorated.
They are calling out to be filled with spiritual content, because they are otherwise empty.

Let's connect these books through space and time, and fill them with the content they deserve. Let's connect the past,
through the present, to the future.

We are travellers having travelled the world and met amazing people with amazing thoughts, dreams, feelings and ideas.
We wish to fill the books from the lady with this amazing content. For this we will use the latest technology. We
will automate the process whereby someone orders a book online. The RESTful api calls will then propagate through
humanities greatest invention, The Internet, down to a little 3D printed automation robot sitting next to a rice field in
Bali. Our faithful robot has no scary artificial intelligence. It is only our humble servant. It will serve us, by
feeding the information colected by our travellers, through an algorithm, using carefully selected True Type Fonts, into
g-code to be fed into our custum built lazer engraver.

Our lady will then take these sacred pages and bind them into a books. Each book handmade. Each book unique. For you and for everyone and everything you love.

This is how we will show to the world what our most beautiful lady can do.
