# Banana Leaf Publishing

*By Appointment To The Royal Court Of Ubud*

In a cave, in a secret location in Bali, lives a mysterious Woman. She is the maker of books.
The books have a beautiful aura of spirituality, they are handmade of rice paper, and beutifully decorated.
They are calling out to be filled with spiritual content, because they are otherwise empty.

Let's connect these books through space and time, and fill them with the content they deserve. Let's connect the past,
through the present, to the future.

We are travellers having travelled the world and met amazing people with amazing thoughts, dreams, feelings and ideas.
We wish to fill the books from the lady with this amazing content. For this we will use the latest technology. We
will automate the process whereby someone orders a book online, and receives a book to their home. The RESTful api calls will  propagate through
humanities greatest invention, The Internet, down to a little 3D printed automation robot sitting next to a rice field in
Bali. Our faithful robot has no scary artificial intelligence. It is only our humble servant. It will serve us, by
feeding the information colected by our travellers, through an algorithm, using carefully selected True Type Fonts, into
g-code to be fed into our custum built lazer engraver.

Our lady will then take these sacred pages and bind them into a books. Each book handmade. Each book unique. For you and for everyone and everything you love.

This is how we will show to the world what our most beautiful lady can do.

## Stakeholders

- ___The Lady___<br>I don't know to much concrete information about this lady. I know that she sells the books on Hanoman Street. She doesn't have a shop. The story about the cave is hearsay based on something I heard from a taxt driver. It would be beneficial to investigate further. I think the right time to connect with her again is when I have a prototype for a printed book.
- ___The Princess Of Ubub___<br>The princess has given me a verbal agreement that I can use the tag line "By Appointment To The Royal Court Of Ubud", provided that I publish the biography of Anak Agung Gde Ngurah Mandera. He is connected to the Royal Family, born in 1905, and the first Balinese to engage actively in promoting Balinese culture internatinally. He was invited to Paris and The Netherlands. It's quite an interesting story and it hasn't been published before. The biography is written by his son, and exists only as a hard copy manuscript of which I have been given a copy by the princess. This needs to be transcribed into electronic form, translated to english and layoted to fit in book form.
- ___Online Marketer___<br>I need to connect with someone who knows about affiliate marketing, drop shipping, social media marketing, SEO and such things. The business will rely on selling its products in an online on-demand bookstore, and it is key to drive traffic and potential customers to this site. It is noteworthy that the business model fits exactly in to the process of how this is currently done with other products on the Internet, so anyone who knows about this things will be able to use their skillset. I recognize the importance of this, and I'm therefore willing to share generously on a revenue share basis. Online marketing can be used to reach end customers, and also potential writers and brick and mortar shops to act as distributers.
- ___Writers___<br>From a writers point of view, the business will provide the service of a book publisher. I will be a book publisher with a twist, however, and the business will provide the writer with the opportunity to publish their work in a very unique way. I immagine that this would be especially attractive to writers of particular content, such as poets or writers of content that can be seen as spiritual in some sense. Maybe a spiritual healer who has always had the dream to publish a book?
- ___Brick And Mortar Shops___<br>A useful feature of these books is, I think, that hey can be sold a novelty items in shops that does no otherwise sell books. I'm thinking here about shops in areas such as Camden Town in London. A google image search for [camden shops](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=camden+shops) will reveal which type of shops I think about, and I think similar shops exists in similar areas in cities around the world. We can offer these shops deals where they can buy books at a reduced wholesale price so that they can sell the books at similar prices as we sell them in the online shop so they can make a profit from the sale.
- ___The End Customer___<br>The end customer is a parson who likes to read. Who likes art and beautiful things. Who likes to feel (or be seen) as "artsy". Perhaps someone who likes to show their home to his/her firends and who likes their friend to notice unique and beautiful books in the bookshelf?
