# Bamboo Farm

## Background

I have gotten the impression that it is awesome and sustainable to build with bamboo. This impresion is based on a number
of experiences, for example from visiting [Bamboo Village](http://bamboo-village.blogspot.co.id/) outside Kuala Lumpour.
I also know that there is bamboo growing in e.g. Kenya, but not a lot is done with it. In Indonesia there is a long
tradition to build with bamboo.

## Problem
There is currently a shortage of bamboo on the market. I heard this when visiting
[Pearl Beach Resort](http://pearlbeach-resort.com/) on Gili Ashahan.
