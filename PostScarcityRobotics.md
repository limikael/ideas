# Post Scarcity Robotics

This is the continuation of this project: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/post-scarcity-robotics-food

## Problem

We need to wake up at a specific time every morning and do something we don't enjoy, just to be able to eat. (employment)

## Solution

Let's create robots that can grow our food for us, so we don't have to work.

## Community

This is not a business really, but rather a community, similar to the Wordpress community. However, it will create several
business opportunities for the members of the community, in the same way as the Wordpress community does.
