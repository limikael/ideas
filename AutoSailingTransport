# AutoSailingTransport

I would like to participate in the community building autonomous sailing vessels. It would be awesome to be able to transport
goods around the world without relying on human labour or fossil fuels. There is currently a challenge where teams are
competing to sail an autonomous vessel across the atlantic, but no team has been able to do it yet.
