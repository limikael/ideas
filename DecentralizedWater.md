# Decentralized Water Distribution

## Background

Engineering over the last couple of decades has seen a shif from big centralized solution, to more small and decentralized.
An example of this is the big telecom companies in the past, compared to how Internet is distributed today. This is an
idea to do the same this with water distribution.

## Problem

There are many people all over the world who are disempowered due to lack of, or centralized control of, their water.

## Solution

The idea is based on a little IoT device. The device would attached to a water pipe, and capable of:

- Measuring the flow of water through it.
- Opening and closing a valve to start and stop the flow.
- Both of the things above (reporting as well as control) can be done remotely over the Internet.

Based on this device, the idea is to create something similar to a [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking)
where each hop in the network can be indivitually owned and maintained. Someone can dig a well and sell the water for one
rupee per liter. Someone can build a pipe from there, and 2km further away sell the water for two rupee per liter. And 2km
from there, someone can sell it for 3 rupee. Someone can then build a pipe directly from the well to the last point, and sell 
the water for 2.5 rupee per liter. Market forces would assure reliability and redundance.
